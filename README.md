WebsocketServer
===============

A reference implementation for a WebSocket server and two sample clients. Conforms to all relevant parts of RFC 6455 (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) required or a minimal, non-SSl/TLS, implementation.Tested under Firefox 13 and Chrome 20.

Just run the server from the command-line and load the clients from the browser.

I took the clients from existing, broken implementations found online. Unfortunately, there's no trace of where I got the original code from. If these other websites are discovered, I'd be happy to acknowledge their contribution.
