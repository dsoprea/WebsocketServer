WebsocketServer
===============

A reference implementation for a WebSocket server and two sample clients. Tested under Firefox 13 and Chrome 20.

Just run the server from the command-line and load the clients from the browser. Bam.

I heavily refactored these from existing, broken implementations online for another project. Unfortunately, there's no trace of where I got the original code from. I apologize to those original authors.
